      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Ragged</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A flop (or board) that doesn't appear to help anybody very much. A flop that came down J-6-2  would look ragged.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Rainbow</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A flop that contains three different suits, thus no flush can be made on the turn. Can also mean a complete five card board that has no more than two of any suit, thus no flush is possible.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Raise</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To increase the amount of the current bet.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Rake</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">An amount of money taken out of every pot by the dealer. This is the cardroom's income.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Rank</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">The numerical value of a card (as opposed to its suit). Example: "jack," "seven."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Represent</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To play as if you hold a certain hand. For instance, if you raised before the flop, and then raised again when the flop came ace high, you would be representing at least an ace with a good kicker.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Ring Game</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A regular poker game as opposed to a tournament. Also referred to as a "live" game since actual money is in play instead of tournament chips.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">River</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">The fifth and final community card, put out face-up, by itself. Also known as "fifth street." Metaphors involving the river are some of poker's most treasured clich√©s, e.g., "He drowned in the river."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Rock</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A player who plays very tight, not very creatively. He raises only with the best hands. A real rock is fairly predictable: if he raises you on the river, you can throw away just about anything but the nuts.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Runner</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">Typically said "runner-runner" to describe a hand that was made only by catching the correct cards on both the turn and the river. Example: "He made a runner-runner flush to beat my trips." See also "backdoor."</p>
