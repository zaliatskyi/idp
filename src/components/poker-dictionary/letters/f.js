      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Family Pot</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A pot in which all (or almost all) of the players call before the flop.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Fast</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">As in "play fast." To play a hand aggressively, betting and raising as much as possible. Example: "When you flop a set but there's a flush draw possible, you have to play it fast."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Favourite</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A poker hand which is the statistical favorite to win.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Flop</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">The first three community cards, put out face-up, altogether.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Fold</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To forfeit any chance of winning the current pot in poker. To lay down your hand or throw your hand in instead of calling or raising a bet.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Foul</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A hand that may not be played for one reason or another. A player with a foul hand may not make any claim on any portion of the pot. Example: "He ended up with three cards after the flop, so the dealer declared his hand foul."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Free Card</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A turn or river card on which you don't have to call a bet because of play earlier in the hand (or because of your reputation with your opponents). For instance, if you are on the button and raise when you flop a flush draw, your opponents may check to you on the turn. If you make your flush on the turn, you can bet. If you don't get it on the turn, you can check as well, seeing the river card for "free."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Free Roll</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">One player has a shot at winning an entire pot when he is currently tied with another player. For instance, suppose you have A-Q of clubs and your opponent has A-Q of hearts. The flop is Q-5-T including two clubs. You are tied with your opponent right now, but are free rolling, because you can win the whole pot and your opponent can't. If no club comes, you split the pot with him; if it does come, you win the whole thing.</p>
