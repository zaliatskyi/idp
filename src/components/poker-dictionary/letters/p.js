      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Pay Off</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To call a bet when the bettor is representing a hand that you can't beat, but the pot is sufficiently large to justify a call anyway. Example: "He played it exactly like he made the flush, but I had top set so I paid him off."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Play the Board</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To show down a hand in Hold'em when your cards don't make a hand any better than is shown on the board. For instance, if you have 22, and the board is 4-4-9-9-A (no flush possible), then you must "play the board": the best possible hand you can make doesn't use any of your cards. Note that if you play the board, the best you can do is split the pot with all remaining players.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Pocket</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">Your unique cards that only you can see. For instance, "He had pocket sixes" (a pair of sixes), or "I had ace-king in the pocket." See also “hole cards”.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Pocket Pair</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A Hold'em starting hand with two cards of the same rank, making a pair. Example: "I had big pocket pairs seven times in the first hour. What else can you ask for?"</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Post</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To put in a blind bet, generally required when you first sit down in a cardroom game. You may also be required to post a blind if you change seats at the table in a way that moves you away from the blinds. Example: a player leaves one seat at a table and takes another in such a way that he moves farther from the blinds. He is required to post an extra blind to receive a hand. See also "extra blind."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Pot Limit</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A version of poker in which a player may bet up to the amount of money in the pot whenever it is his turn to act. Like No Limit, this is a very different game from limit poker.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Pot Odds</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">The amount of money in the pot compared to the amount you must put in the pot to continue playing. For example, suppose there is $60 in the pot. Somebody bets $6, so the pot now contains $66. It costs you $6 to call, so your pot odds are 11:1. If your chance of having the best hand is at least 1 out of 12, you should call. Pot odds also apply to draws. For instance, suppose you have a draw to the nut flush with one card left to come. In this case, you are about a 4:1 underdog to make your flush. If it costs you $8 to call the bet, then there must be about $32 in the pot (including the most recent bet) to make your call correct.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Price</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">The pot odds you are getting for a draw or call. Example: "The pot was laying me a high enough price, so I stayed in with my gutshot straight draw."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Protect</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">(1) To keep your hand or a chip on your cards. This prevents them from being fouled by a discarded hand, or accidentally mucked by the dealer. (2) To invest more money in a pot so blind money that you've already put in isn't "wasted." Example: "He'll always protect his blinds, no matter how bad his cards are."</p>
