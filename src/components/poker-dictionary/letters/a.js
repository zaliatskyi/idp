      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Action</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">(1) Opportunity to act. If a player appears not to realize it's their turn, the dealer will say "Your action." (2) Bets and raises. "If a third heart hits the board and there's a lot of action, you have to assume that somebody has made the flush."</p>

      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Ante</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A small portion of a bet contributed by each player to seed the pot at the beginning of a poker hand. Most Hold'em games do not have an ante; they use "blinds" to get initial money into the pot.</p>

      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">All-in</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To run out of chips while betting or calling. In table stakes games, a player may not go into their pocket for more money during a hand. If they run out, a side pot is created in which they have no interest. However, they can still win the pot for which they had the chips. Example: "Poor Bob. He made quads against the big full house, but he was all-in on the second bet."</p>
