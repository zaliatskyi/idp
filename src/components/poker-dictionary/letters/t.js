      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Table Stakes</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A rule in a poker game meaning that a player may not go into his pocket for money during a hand. He may only invest the amount of money in front of him into the current pot. If he runs out of chips during the hand, a side pot is created in which he has no interest. All casino poker is played table stakes. The definition sometimes also includes the rule that a player may not remove chips from the table during a game. While this rule might not be referred to as "table stakes," it is enforced almost universally in public poker games.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Tell</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A clue or hint that a player unknowingly gives about the strength of his hand, his next action, etc. May originally be from "telegraph" or the obvious use that he "tells" you what he's going to do before he does it.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Tilt</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">To play wildly or recklessly. A player is said to be "on tilt" if he is not playing his best, playing too many hands, trying wild bluffs, raising with bad hands, etc.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Time</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">(1) A request by a player to suspend play while he decides what he's going to do. Simply, "Time, please!" If a player doesn't request time and there is a substantial amount of action behind him, the dealer may rule that the player has folded. (2) An amount of money collected either on the button or every half hour by the cardroom. This is another way for the house to make its money (see "rake").</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Toke</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A small amount of money (typically $.50 or $1.00) given to the dealer by the winner of a pot. Quite often, tokes represent the great majority of a dealer's income.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Top Pair</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">A pair with the highest card on the flop. If you have A-Q, and the flop comes Q-T-6, you have flopped top pair. See "second pair."</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Top Set</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">The highest possible trips. Example: you have T-T, and the flop comes T-8-9. You have flopped top set.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Top Two</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">Two pair, with your two hole cards pairing the two highest cards on the board.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Top and Bottom</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">Two pair, with your two hole cards pairing the highest and lowest cards on the board.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Trips</h3>
      <p className="dictionary__block-text">Three of a kind.</p>
      <h3 className="dictionary__block-header">Turn</h3>
